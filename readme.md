### ⚙️ In this project, I utilized ⚛️ React for the front-end development, 🎨 Sass for styling and react-icons to SVG Icons. React provided a robust and efficient library for creating dynamic user interfaces, while Sass allowed for the development of modular and easily maintainable styles. The combination of these technologies ensured a smooth development process and a high-quality end product. React Icons simplifies the usage, styling, and implementation of SVG icons.
